# Attack Simulation: Malware and LOLBins Activity

## Objective
Simulate malicious activity using native operating system tools to evade traditional security controls.

---

## Attack Scenario
An attacker executes commands using built-in Windows utilities (LOLBins) instead of deploying custom malware.

---

## Simulated Attacker Actions
- PowerShell execution
- LOLBins usage (certutil, rundll32)
- Temporary file creation

---

## Observed Telemetry
- Process execution logs
- Suspicious command-line arguments
- Malware-related alerts

---

## SOC Visibility
- Detection of abnormal process behavior
- Correlation with malware alerts
- Analyst validation and response

---

## Defensive Outcome
- Malicious activity identified
- Endpoint isolated
- Detection logic refined
